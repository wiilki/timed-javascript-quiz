# timed-javascript-quiz-wk

## Description

This is a short JavaScript quiz I created to demonstrate my coding skills. I focused on using React to build different components for each part of the quiz. The main challenge was managing event listeners and keeping track of variables while rendering data from local storage. After some testing and a couple of restarts, I learned the importance of planning before diving into coding. It's crucial for staying organized and saving time in the long run.

Enjoy!
